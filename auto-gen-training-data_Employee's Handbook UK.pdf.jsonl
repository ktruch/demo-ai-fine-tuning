Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.     When running late, it’s courteous to  let the other party know  and keep them in the loop about your  schedule.    If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual. This means that jeans or chinos, a shirt and casual shoes  are appropriate, while sportswear is not recommended.     All clothing should be clean, ironed and in good shape.      Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   7/10  All employees should maintain an acceptable level of bodily hygiene to ensure that interactions  with other staff and clients remain positive and pleasant.   6. Employment  6.1 Probation Period   All new employees are subject to a probationary period, the length of this period is defined within your contract of employment. During this period, you will be given the appropriate support and  development to help you reach the required standards. At the end of the probationary period, you  will be informed in writing if it has been successfully completed.   6.2 Hours of Work   Your normal hours of work are detailed within  your contract of employment.   6.3 Taking Breaks   You have the right to one uninterrupted 20- minute rest break during your working day if you work  more than 6 hours a day. There might be more details in your contract of employment.      The break must be taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or  end) and can be taken away from your desk or workstation.   6.4 Role De scription   A full description of your role and responsibilities is available SharePoint > Role Description .  6.5 Time Tracking   All work hours must be reported in Project Web App (PWA, also known as MSPS) at the latest by  Monday noon the following week.   6.6 Your Attendance at Wor k  TBSGC values good attendance at work and is committed to improving the general well- being of  its employees to achieve this. Although we aim to secure regular attendance, we do not expect  employees to attend when they are unwell.   6.5.1 Notification of Absence   If you are unable to attend work due to sickness or injury, you need to send an email to  sick@tbscg.com , your General Manager and Delivery Manager. This should be done before y our  normal start time or as soon thereafter as possible on the first day of absence.    During prolonged periods of absence, your managers should be kept updated regularly and advised of the anticipated return date.   6.5.2 Sick Pay   Employees must provide the Office Administrator with a sick note if they’ve been ill for more than 7 days consecutively and have taken sick leave. This includes non -working days, such as  weekends and Bank holidays.    If employees are off work for 7 days or less, they do not need to provide a sick note.  Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   8/10  Employees who are off work sick for prolonged periods of time, may receive Statutory Sick Pay  (SSP) for up to 28 weeks.   6.6 Annual Leave   The holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December. You can see your holiday entitlement in  your contract of employment.    A full -time employee is entitled to 25 days’ holiday, plus 1 additional day for each completed holiday  year of continuous employment  with the company, up to a maximum of 30 days.     All holidays must be booked and approved in advance. To do so, follow the process described in  Confluence > Administrative Processes .    You should try to give as much notice as possible to enable any operational difficulties to be resolved.   All employees should seek to use their annual leave within the calendar year to which it relates.    It is possible to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the next calendar year, as notified by the Office Administrator.    In addition, TBSCG reserves the right to request the  employee to take their holid ays when  suitable  in certain circumstances.    All holidays can be tracked Dynamics 365 (CRM ) > Staff  > Holidays report . Contact the Office  Administrator for more information.    6.7 Working From Home   If you wish to or need to work from home, it is necessary for you to adhere to the following rules:   − You need to ensure that your home office workplace is safe and that you have the necessary equipment and appropriate space to work effectively. Keep in mind all company policies, specifically the ones related to privacy and security.   − When working remotely , you need to be able to adhere to company work schedules and  timetables.   − Once the contract of employment comes to an end  by either party , all TBSCG assets must   be returned to the office location.

TBSCG will ensure that workstations meet the regulation standards and will carry out risk assessments on display screens and equipment.

Employees are expected to attend eye tests and subsequent visits to the opticians in their own time.   9.3 Fire Safety   All employees should familiarise themselves with the action they need to take in case of fire and evacuation of the building.   9.4 Entry System   Within offices where it is relevant, s wipe cards must only be used by the person they have been  issued to and  must not be given or lent to anyone else.   9.5 Security   As a responsible organisation, TBSCG takes s ecurity seriously, both personal and information  security.

If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual. This means that jeans or chinos, a shirt and casual shoes  are appropriate, while sportswear is not recommended.     All clothing should be clean, ironed and in good shape.

Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.

Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.     When running late, it’s courteous to  let the other party know  and keep them in the loop about your  schedule.    If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual. This means that jeans or chinos, a shirt and casual shoes  are appropriate, while sportswear is not recommended.     All clothing should be clean, ironed and in good shape.      Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   7/10  All employees should maintain an acceptable level of bodily hygiene to ensure that interactions  with other staff and clients remain positive and pleasant.   6. Employment  6.1 Probation Period   All new employees are subject to a probationary period, the length of this period is defined within your contract of employment. During this period, you will be given the appropriate support and  development to help you reach the required standards. At the end of the probationary period, you  will be informed in writing if it has been successfully completed.   6.2 Hours of Work   Your normal hours of work are detailed within  your contract of employment.   6.3 Taking Breaks   You have the right to one uninterrupted 20- minute rest break during your working day if you work  more than 6 hours a day. There might be more details in your contract of employment.      The break must be taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or  end) and can be taken away from your desk or workstation.   6.4 Role De scription   A full description of your role and responsibilities is available SharePoint > Role Description .  6.5 Time Tracking   All work hours must be reported in Project Web App (PWA, also known as MSPS) at the latest by  Monday noon the following week.   6.6 Your Attendance at Wor k  TBSGC values good attendance at work and is committed to improving the general well- being of  its employees to achieve this. Although we aim to secure regular attendance, we do not expect  employees to attend when they are unwell.   6.5.1 Notification of Absence   If you are unable to attend work due to sickness or injury, you need to send an email to  sick@tbscg.com , your General Manager and Delivery Manager. This should be done before y our  normal start time or as soon thereafter as possible on the first day of absence.    During prolonged periods of absence, your managers should be kept updated regularly and advised of the anticipated return date.   6.5.2 Sick Pay   Employees must provide the Office Administrator with a sick note if they’ve been ill for more than 7 days consecutively and have taken sick leave. This includes non -working days, such as  weekends and Bank holidays.    If employees are off work for 7 days or less, they do not need to provide a sick note.  Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   8/10  Employees who are off work sick for prolonged periods of time, may receive Statutory Sick Pay  (SSP) for up to 28 weeks.   6.6 Annual Leave   The holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December. You can see your holiday entitlement in  your contract of employment.    A full -time employee is entitled to 25 days’ holiday, plus 1 additional day for each completed holiday  year of continuous employment  with the company, up to a maximum of 30 days.     All holidays must be booked and approved in advance. To do so, follow the process described in  Confluence > Administrative Processes .    You should try to give as much notice as possible to enable any operational difficulties to be resolved.   All employees should seek to use their annual leave within the calendar year to which it relates.    It is possible to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the next calendar year, as notified by the Office Administrator.    In addition, TBSCG reserves the right to request the  employee to take their holid ays when  suitable  in certain circumstances.    All holidays can be tracked Dynamics 365 (CRM ) > Staff  > Holidays report . Contact the Office  Administrator for more information.    6.7 Working From Home   If you wish to or need to work from home, it is necessary for you to adhere to the following rules:   − You need to ensure that your home office workplace is safe and that you have the necessary equipment and appropriate space to work effectively. Keep in mind all company policies, specifically the ones related to privacy and security.   − When working remotely , you need to be able to adhere to company work schedules and  timetables.   − Once the contract of employment comes to an end  by either party , all TBSCG assets must   be returned to the office location.

Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.     When running late, it’s courteous to  let the other party know  and keep them in the loop about your  schedule.    If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual. This means that jeans or chinos, a shirt and casual shoes  are appropriate, while sportswear is not recommended.     All clothing should be clean, ironed and in good shape.      Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   7/10  All employees should maintain an acceptable level of bodily hygiene to ensure that interactions  with other staff and clients remain positive and pleasant.   6. Employment  6.1 Probation Period   All new employees are subject to a probationary period, the length of this period is defined within your contract of employment. During this period, you will be given the appropriate support and  development to help you reach the required standards. At the end of the probationary period, you  will be informed in writing if it has been successfully completed.   6.2 Hours of Work   Your normal hours of work are detailed within  your contract of employment.   6.3 Taking Breaks   You have the right to one uninterrupted 20- minute rest break during your working day if you work  more than 6 hours a day. There might be more details in your contract of employment.      The break must be taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or  end) and can be taken away from your desk or workstation.   6.4 Role De scription   A full description of your role and responsibilities is available SharePoint > Role Description .  6.5 Time Tracking   All work hours must be reported in Project Web App (PWA, also known as MSPS) at the latest by  Monday noon the following week.   6.6 Your Attendance at Wor k  TBSGC values good attendance at work and is committed to improving the general well- being of  its employees to achieve this. Although we aim to secure regular attendance, we do not expect  employees to attend when they are unwell.   6.5.1 Notification of Absence   If you are unable to attend work due to sickness or injury, you need to send an email to  sick@tbscg.com , your General Manager and Delivery Manager. This should be done before y our  normal start time or as soon thereafter as possible on the first day of absence.    During prolonged periods of absence, your managers should be kept updated regularly and advised of the anticipated return date.   6.5.2 Sick Pay   Employees must provide the Office Administrator with a sick note if they’ve been ill for more than 7 days consecutively and have taken sick leave. This includes non -working days, such as  weekends and Bank holidays.    If employees are off work for 7 days or less, they do not need to provide a sick note.  Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   8/10  Employees who are off work sick for prolonged periods of time, may receive Statutory Sick Pay  (SSP) for up to 28 weeks.   6.6 Annual Leave   The holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December. You can see your holiday entitlement in  your contract of employment.    A full -time employee is entitled to 25 days’ holiday, plus 1 additional day for each completed holiday  year of continuous employment  with the company, up to a maximum of 30 days.     All holidays must be booked and approved in advance. To do so, follow the process described in  Confluence > Administrative Processes .    You should try to give as much notice as possible to enable any operational difficulties to be resolved.   All employees should seek to use their annual leave within the calendar year to which it relates.    It is possible to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the next calendar year, as notified by the Office Administrator.    In addition, TBSCG reserves the right to request the  employee to take their holid ays when  suitable  in certain circumstances.    All holidays can be tracked Dynamics 365 (CRM ) > Staff  > Holidays report . Contact the Office  Administrator for more information.    6.7 Working From Home   If you wish to or need to work from home, it is necessary for you to adhere to the following rules:   − You need to ensure that your home office workplace is safe and that you have the necessary equipment and appropriate space to work effectively. Keep in mind all company policies, specifically the ones related to privacy and security.   − When working remotely , you need to be able to adhere to company work schedules and  timetables.   − Once the contract of employment comes to an end  by either party , all TBSCG assets must   be returned to the office location.

Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual.

Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.     When running late, it’s courteous to  let the other party know  and keep them in the loop about your  schedule.    If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.

Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.     When running late, it’s courteous to  let the other party know  and keep them in the loop about your  schedule.    If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual. This means that jeans or chinos, a shirt and casual shoes  are appropriate, while sportswear is not recommended.     All clothing should be clean, ironed and in good shape.      Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   7/10  All employees should maintain an acceptable level of bodily hygiene to ensure that interactions  with other staff and clients remain positive and pleasant.   6. Employment  6.1 Probation Period   All new employees are subject to a probationary period, the length of this period is defined within your contract of employment. During this period, you will be given the appropriate support and  development to help you reach the required standards. At the end of the probationary period, you  will be informed in writing if it has been successfully completed.   6.2 Hours of Work   Your normal hours of work are detailed within  your contract of employment.   6.3 Taking Breaks   You have the right to one uninterrupted 20- minute rest break during your working day if you work  more than 6 hours a day. There might be more details in your contract of employment.      The break must be taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or  end) and can be taken away from your desk or workstation.   6.4 Role De scription   A full description of your role and responsibilities is available SharePoint > Role Description .  6.5 Time Tracking   All work hours must be reported in Project Web App (PWA, also known as MSPS) at the latest by  Monday noon the following week.   6.6 Your Attendance at Wor k  TBSGC values good attendance at work and is committed to improving the general well- being of  its employees to achieve this. Although we aim to secure regular attendance, we do not expect  employees to attend when they are unwell.   6.5.1 Notification of Absence   If you are unable to attend work due to sickness or injury, you need to send an email to  sick@tbscg.com , your General Manager and Delivery Manager. This should be done before y our  normal start time or as soon thereafter as possible on the first day of absence.    During prolonged periods of absence, your managers should be kept updated regularly and advised of the anticipated return date.   6.5.2 Sick Pay   Employees must provide the Office Administrator with a sick note if they’ve been ill for more than 7 days consecutively and have taken sick leave. This includes non -working days, such as  weekends and Bank holidays.    If employees are off work for 7 days or less, they do not need to provide a sick note.  Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   8/10  Employees who are off work sick for prolonged periods of time, may receive Statutory Sick Pay  (SSP) for up to 28 weeks.   6.6 Annual Leave   The holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December. You can see your holiday entitlement in  your contract of employment.    A full -time employee is entitled to 25 days’ holiday, plus 1 additional day for each completed holiday  year of continuous employment  with the company, up to a maximum of 30 days.     All holidays must be booked and approved in advance. To do so, follow the process described in  Confluence > Administrative Processes .    You should try to give as much notice as possible to enable any operational difficulties to be resolved.   All employees should seek to use their annual leave within the calendar year to which it relates.    It is possible to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the next calendar year, as notified by the Office Administrator.    In addition, TBSCG reserves the right to request the  employee to take their holid ays when  suitable  in certain circumstances.    All holidays can be tracked Dynamics 365 (CRM ) > Staff  > Holidays report . Contact the Office  Administrator for more information.    6.7 Working From Home   If you wish to or need to work from home, it is necessary for you to adhere to the following rules:   − You need to ensure that your home office workplace is safe and that you have the necessary equipment and appropriate space to work effectively. Keep in mind all company policies, specifically the ones related to privacy and security.   − When working remotely , you need to be able to adhere to company work schedules and  timetables.   − Once the contract of employment comes to an end  by either party , all TBSCG assets must   be returned to the office location.

From your start date, the following benefits will automatically apply:   − Death in Service Insurance (MetLife), 4 times your annual gross salary.   − Company Business Travel Insurance (AIG)    After successful completion of your probation period, you are entitled to the benefits listed below:  Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   9/10  − Private Health Insurance  (Vitality) for you, your partner and/or your family.   − Pension 3% company, 5% employee  (Legal & General)     The Office Administrator will provide you with all necessary information accordingly.    6.9 Changes in Personal Information   For employment  purposes, i t is important that our records are correct, as inaccurate  or out of date  information may affect your salary or cause difficulties in situations where contact is required for emergencies.

Professional Etiquette Rules    5.1 Planning and Punctuality: Be on Time   Whether arriving at the office or attending a client’s meeting, being punctual shows that you’re  professional and respect the others’ time.     If you are late to a meeting, your whole team is affected and may have to cover for you.     Clients expect high -quality service so if you are late to a meeting, the client might question their  money and wonder if you value their time.     When running late, it’s courteous to  let the other party know  and keep them in the loop about your  schedule.    If you’ve got a  virtual meeting  or a call scheduled, make sure you’re prepared for it with plenty of  time to spare, with your devi ce switched on, apps open, video and audio working.   5.2 Online Meetings   You should aim to create a work environment wherever you are.     If you’re working from home, make sure you set up a designated place for work. Your home might  not have a study, but you could use a separate room with a closed door, away from any distractions.  This will also help you to distinguish your work life from your home life.     Do your best to keep your surroundings looking professional. A blank wall, a tasteful painting, or a  bookshe lf works well. Don’t let people see a pile of dirty laundry or the kids’ toys in the background!     Decent lighting is also essential. You can check this by doing a test video. Angle your device  correctly, so you (not the ceiling or floor) are front and cent re.    It’s fine to stay in your pyjamas all day if nobody’s going to see you, but for a video conference, you  should make an effort to wear work clothes. This includes your lower half – you never know if you’re  going to have to get up from the screen, so don’t be tempted to pair a shirt and tie with trackie  bottoms (or nothing at all!). Dressing the part, even in the home office, will also help you get into  the right frame of mind for work.     If you’re going to be on a long call, prepare  by making a drink and  using the toilet before starting.  Eating while on a call is a no -no as it looks unprofessional. The same goes for the temptation to  multitask, such as taking other phone calls or replying to messages on a different screen – even  while you’re on mute.     It’s best to keep your microphone on mute until it’s your turn to speak, to avoid any possible  background noise. Nobody needs to hear you clearing your throat or slurping your coffee. It also  helps with the quality of the call if everyone except the current s peaker is muted.    Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   6/10  Maintaining eye contact with people on the screen is an important part of remote work etiquette,  as is body language. Try to look as if you’re interested at all times, not staring off into space or  chewing on the end of your pen.    Be aware of facial expressions – you might get away with eye -rolls on an audio- only call, but not  on video. Make sure you look alert and fully awake, even for early morning calls.     Before your call, make sure you know how to use the software, and that the equipment is working  correctly.     It’s simple to test the audio and cameras on your device, or even make a test call. Your colleagues  will get annoyed if they have to wait around while you yell “can you hear me now?” into the mic,  wasting everyone’s valuab le time.    Most video conferencing software have backgrounds and filters, which can be fun when chatting  with family and friends. It’s best, though, to keep these out of professional meetings, unless you’re  with a particularly close group of colleagues or the meeting is deliberately informal.   5.3 Be Polite and Professional in All Communication Forms   For phone, email and meetings, it’s important to remain professional. When emailing, keep in mind  that there is no context for tone or facial expressions, so keep messages short but friendly. Do not  send anything that you wouldn’t say in person as emails are permanent.     Pick the most appropriate method for the person or topic you’re dealing with. Sometimes a quick  message is all that’s required, but other times you’ll need to convey more detailed information and  think carefully about what you’re typing.     Forgetting to turn  off the caps lock in emails is a rookie error, but caps will be used  for this next  point : ALWAYS PROOFREAD YOUR MESSAGES! It’s amazing how many people don’t do this. It looks  so unprofessional to see spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors, let alone using the wrong word  entirely.    This should go without saying, but make sure you spell the recipient’s name right. Use BCC to  protect people’s privacy, and don’t accidentally select “Send to All”. Use the email’s subject line to  define what it’s about and set the urgency level so that it’s easy to search for later.     While emails are often the modern equivalent of a formal letter, there’s sometimes a tendency to  see instant messaging as the informal option. But in a work context, these messages should remain  just as professional as any other type of communication.   5.4 Dress Code   The dress code is generally smart casual. This means that jeans or chinos, a shirt and casual shoes  are appropriate, while sportswear is not recommended.     All clothing should be clean, ironed and in good shape.

This includes non -working days, such as  weekends and Bank holidays.    If employees are off work for 7 days or less, they do not need to provide a sick note.  Employee's Handbook UK   Information classification: Proprietary   8/10  Employees who are off work sick for prolonged periods of time, may receive Statutory Sick Pay  (SSP) for up to 28 weeks.   6.6 Annual Leave   The holiday year runs from 1st January to 31st December. You can see your holiday entitlement in  your contract of employment.

All holidays must be booked and approved in advance. To do so, follow the process described in  Confluence > Administrative Processes .
