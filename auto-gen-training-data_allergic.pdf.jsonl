Easy tips to prevent and control your allergy 1What is an allergy? An allergy is a reaction that occurs when the body’s natural  defenses (immune system) overreact to a foreign substance  called an allergen . Allergens themselves are harmless; it is our  body’s extreme response to them that causes the unwanted  symptoms.  How do allergies develop? At any age our immune system can create unique proteins  called antibodies that are programmed to recognize and  respond to a specific allergen, even one that we have  been around our entire lives. When this occurs, it is called  sensitization. The next time the person is exposed to that  allergen, the immune system recognizes it and attacks, causing  an allergic reaction with associated symptoms. Though anyone  can develop allergies at anytime , some families are more  prone to them. Individuals do not inherit an allergy to a specific  allergen, but the overall likelihood of developing allergies is  increased when other family members have allergies. What are allergens? Most allergens are proteins . Common sources of allergens  include various foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs,  fruit, fish, and shellfish. Non-food allergens include pollens,  mold spores, dust mites, cockroaches, latex, insect venom (i.e.  bee sting), drugs (i.e. penicillin), or animals.  Animal allergens  are typically found in urine, saliva, skin, and feces; and can  be carried on hair and dander (tiny scales from skin, hair, or  feathers) . Allergens from pets are  small and lightweight so  once in the air, they can remain suspended for long periods of  time eventually settling down on carpets, bedding, furniture,  and other items in the home. Additionally, people can carry pet  allergens on their hair and clothing. How common are allergies to pets? It is estimated that 30 to 40 percent of the world’s population  suffers from one or more allergic disorders and the prevalence  of allergic disease has been rising worldwide. Among U.S.  citizens of all ages, allergies are the fifth leading cause of  chronic diseases, and asthma (often triggered by allergies)  is the third most common chronic disease in children under  eighteen years old. In addition, the Asthma and Allergy  Foundation of America reports allergies to pets are very  common affecting millions of Americans. An estimated 15 to  30 percent of people with allergies have a reaction to cats  or dogs, with cat allergies being twice as common as dog  allergies . What are the symptoms of pet allergies? A common misconception regarding pet allergies is that the  development of aches and pains or fever is part of the normal  allergic response. That is not true. Pet allergies typically cause  nose, eye, skin, and respiratory (lung and throat), symptoms .  These may lead to a decreased quality of life, including  difficulty sleeping and a lack of energy. Nose and eye symptoms: • Sneezing • Runny or stuffy nose • Red, itchy, or watery eyes • Itchy nose, throat, or roof of mouth Skin symptoms: • Dry, itchy skin • Rashes, hives Those whose pet allergies trigger allergic bronchitis or asthma,  may also develop the following  Respiratory symptoms: • Cough • Wheezing (whistling sound) when breathing • Chest tightness  • Shortness of breath In extreme pet allergy c ases, a severe reaction can occur,  known as anaphylaxis , in which the allergic individual may  experience itching, hives, swelling, respiratory distress, shock,  and even death.  In general, symptoms will worsen when a person is exposed to  greater amounts of allergens or when several different types  are present. Therefore, reducing the exposure to allergens can  reduce the severity of the symptoms. If I am allergic, can I still have a pet? There are many options for controlling and reducing allergies  through reduction of exposure to allergens and/or treatment of  symptoms. Therefore, most people are able to keep their pets  while managing their allergies . What should I do if I think I have allergies to my pet? Some people assume they have a pet allergy based on their  symptoms, it is important to see your doctor in order to be  certain that you are directing allergy prevention strategies, like  those detailed here, at the correct cause of your symptoms. The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine 2 Veterinary Public Health Program   Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine   1920 Coffey Road Columbus OH, 43210 vet.osu.edu/vph-mph Myth: My dog’s hair/fur causes my allergy symptoms. Fact: The primary dog allergen is produced in the salivary  glands making saliva the main source. The allergens can  be deposited on the dog’s fur through licking, and once the  fur dries, the particles can flake off and become airborne.  Additionally, there are other minor allergens also shed by  dogs that can trigger allergies. One of the newly discovered  allergens is found in dog urine and is believed to contribute  to an increasing number of allergic reactions to dogs. MYTH: Hypoallergenic dogs produce no allergens so they  do not cause allergies. FACT: All dogs produce allergens. The level of different  types of allergens may vary between individual dogs, but  this is not due to a specific gender, breed, or breed mix.  Some allergic individuals tolerate some dogs better than  others due to variations in amounts and types of allergens  produced. However, in spite of advertising claims and higher  prices, no dogs are truly hypoallergenic. MYTH: The length of my dog’s hair/fur affects the amount  of allergen produced. FACT: The production of dog allergens is not related to  hair type or length.  Even hairless dogs produce allergens.  Some dogs do shed less hair than others and that may  impact how widely allergens are spread in the environment;  however, even that does not guarantee a reduction in  allergen exposure. Regardless of hair characteristics,  allergens are still produced in the dog’s saliva and urine. Dog Specific Controls:  ☐Bathe dogs regularly (ideally at least once a week) to remove  allergens from their fur. For your dog’s health use a shampoo  formulated for dogs; all brands tested perform equally well at  reducing allergens.   ☐Restrict dogs from rooms where reduced exposure is desired  (e.g., bedrooms). Airborne dog allergen levels have been found  to be much higher in rooms where dogs are physically present.  ☐Couches have been shown to harbor a large amount of  allergens, so it is recommended to keep dogs and other pets   off of furniture.  ☐Always wash your hands immediately after handling your pet.   General Household Controls:  ☐Avoid “dry” cleaning (brooms and feather dusters) which can  aerosolize pet allergens. Instead use statically charged cleaning  products (eg swiffer) and/or clean with wet supplies such as  damp cloths and mops which will trap and remove allergens. Reduce your exposure to allergens by following the  allergy prevention tips below. Reducing the amount of allergens in your household can  dramatically reduce symptoms of allergies. Best results in  reducing allergens are found when the recommendations listed  here are applied consistently over time. It may take weeks  before results are noticed. Can medical treatment help? When reducing allergen exposure is not enough, there are  many options for controlling allergies and reducing symptoms  through medical management. Depending on the severity  of signs, over the counter (OTC) medicines may provide  temporary allergy relief for symptoms such as runny/itchy  nose and throat, sneezing and itchy/watery eyes. In all cases  talking with your doctor is highly recommended; as some  people may benefit from prescription medicine, allergy  immunotherapy (allergy shots), or other medical treatments .  Some with severe allergies and asthma may be discouraged  from owning pets; however, most people can effectively  manage their symptoms. What should I do if I cannot keep my dog? If prevention and treatment efforts are not enough and your  allergy symptoms are severe, you may need  to find a new home for your dog. Ask family  and friends about placement options before  contacting your local animal shelter . It is also  important to understand that having an allergy  to one type of animal increases your risk of  allergy to another, but it does not guarantee  it. Many people are allergic to dogs, but not  necessarily allergic to other common pet  species.  ☐When laundering bedding, clothing, and other washable items  (including dog beds) use high temperatures and detergents to  remove more allergens.  ☐Vacuum regularly, at least once a week, with a good vacuum  cleaner that is equipped with a HEPA filter to prevent outflow of  the contents (including pet allergens) that have been swept up.  ☐Allergic individuals should avoid cleaning and vacuuming  themselves, or wear a disposable dust mask (available at the  local pharmacy or hardware store) in order to prevent inhalation  of pet allergens. After cleaning it will take a few hours for  allergens released into the air to settle back onto the surfaces.    ☐In addition to using a HEPA filter in household heating and  cooling systems, the use of an air purifier with a HEPA filter in the  room where pets spend the most of their time will reduce the   concentration of allergens in the air.  ☐When possible, replace carpet with smooth flooring (e.g., wood,  tile, linoleum) as carpets are the primary reservoir of allergens in  the home.

However, in spite of advertising claims and higher  prices, no dogs are truly hypoallergenic. MYTH: The length of my dog’s hair/fur affects the amount  of allergen produced. FACT: The production of dog allergens is not related to  hair type or length.  Even hairless dogs produce allergens.  Some dogs do shed less hair than others and that may  impact how widely allergens are spread in the environment;  however, even that does not guarantee a reduction in  allergen exposure. Regardless of hair characteristics,  allergens are still produced in the dog’s saliva and urine. Dog Specific Controls:  ☐Bathe dogs regularly (ideally at least once a week) to remove  allergens from their fur. For your dog’s health use a shampoo  formulated for dogs; all brands tested perform equally well at  reducing allergens.   ☐Restrict dogs from rooms where reduced exposure is desired  (e.g., bedrooms). Airborne dog allergen levels have been found  to be much higher in rooms where dogs are physically present.  ☐Couches have been shown to harbor a large amount of  allergens, so it is recommended to keep dogs and other pets   off of furniture.  ☐Always wash your hands immediately after handling your pet.   General Household Controls:  ☐Avoid “dry” cleaning (brooms and feather dusters) which can  aerosolize pet allergens. Instead use statically charged cleaning  products (eg swiffer) and/or clean with wet supplies such as  damp cloths and mops which will trap and remove allergens.

Depending on the severity  of signs, over the counter (OTC) medicines may provide  temporary allergy relief for symptoms such as runny/itchy  nose and throat, sneezing and itchy/watery eyes. In all cases  talking with your doctor is highly recommended; as some  people may benefit from prescription medicine, allergy  immunotherapy (allergy shots), or other medical treatments .  Some with severe allergies and asthma may be discouraged  from owning pets; however, most people can effectively  manage their symptoms. What should I do if I cannot keep my dog? If prevention and treatment efforts are not enough and your  allergy symptoms are severe, you may need  to find a new home for your dog. Ask family  and friends about placement options before  contacting your local animal shelter . It is also  important to understand that having an allergy  to one type of animal increases your risk of  allergy to another, but it does not guarantee  it. Many people are allergic to dogs, but not  necessarily allergic to other common pet  species.  ☐When laundering bedding, clothing, and other washable items  (including dog beds) use high temperatures and detergents to  remove more allergens.  ☐Vacuum regularly, at least once a week, with a good vacuum  cleaner that is equipped with a HEPA filter to prevent outflow of  the contents (including pet allergens) that have been swept up.  ☐Allergic individuals should avoid cleaning and vacuuming  themselves, or wear a disposable dust mask (available at the  local pharmacy or hardware store) in order to prevent inhalation  of pet allergens. After cleaning it will take a few hours for  allergens released into the air to settle back onto the surfaces.    ☐In addition to using a HEPA filter in household heating and  cooling systems, the use of an air purifier with a HEPA filter in the  room where pets spend the most of their time will reduce the   concentration of allergens in the air.  ☐When possible, replace carpet with smooth flooring (e.g., wood,  tile, linoleum) as carpets are the primary reservoir of allergens in  the home.

At any age our immune system can create unique proteins  called antibodies that are programmed to recognize and  respond to a specific allergen, even one that we have  been around our entire lives. When this occurs, it is called  sensitization. The next time the person is exposed to that  allergen, the immune system recognizes it and attacks, causing  an allergic reaction with associated symptoms. Though anyone  can develop allergies at anytime , some families are more  prone to them. Individuals do not inherit an allergy to a specific  allergen, but the overall likelihood of developing allergies is  increased when other family members have allergies. What are allergens? Most allergens are proteins . Common sources of allergens  include various foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs,  fruit, fish, and shellfish. Non-food allergens include pollens,  mold spores, dust mites, cockroaches, latex, insect venom (i.e.  bee sting), drugs (i.e. penicillin), or animals.  Animal allergens  are typically found in urine, saliva, skin, and feces; and can  be carried on hair and dander (tiny scales from skin, hair, or  feathers) . Allergens from pets are  small and lightweight so  once in the air, they can remain suspended for long periods of  time eventually settling down on carpets, bedding, furniture,  and other items in the home. Additionally, people can carry pet  allergens on their hair and clothing. How common are allergies to pets? It is estimated that 30 to 40 percent of the world’s population  suffers from one or more allergic disorders and the prevalence  of allergic disease has been rising worldwide. Among U.S.  citizens of all ages, allergies are the fifth leading cause of  chronic diseases, and asthma (often triggered by allergies)  is the third most common chronic disease in children under  eighteen years old. In addition, the Asthma and Allergy  Foundation of America reports allergies to pets are very  common affecting millions of Americans. An estimated 15 to  30 percent of people with allergies have a reaction to cats  or dogs, with cat allergies being twice as common as dog  allergies . What are the symptoms of pet allergies? A common misconception regarding pet allergies is that the  development of aches and pains or fever is part of the normal  allergic response. That is not true. Pet allergies typically cause  nose, eye, skin, and respiratory (lung and throat), symptoms .  These may lead to a decreased quality of life, including  difficulty sleeping and a lack of energy. Nose and eye symptoms: • Sneezing • Runny or stuffy nose • Red, itchy, or watery eyes • Itchy nose, throat, or roof of mouth Skin symptoms: • Dry, itchy skin • Rashes, hives Those whose pet allergies trigger allergic bronchitis or asthma,  may also develop the following  Respiratory symptoms: • Cough • Wheezing (whistling sound) when breathing • Chest tightness  • Shortness of breath In extreme pet allergy c ases, a severe reaction can occur,  known as anaphylaxis , in which the allergic individual may  experience itching, hives, swelling, respiratory distress, shock,  and even death.  In general, symptoms will worsen when a person is exposed to  greater amounts of allergens or when several different types  are present. Therefore, reducing the exposure to allergens can  reduce the severity of the symptoms. If I am allergic, can I still have a pet? There are many options for controlling and reducing allergies  through reduction of exposure to allergens and/or treatment of  symptoms. Therefore, most people are able to keep their pets  while managing their allergies . What should I do if I think I have allergies to my pet? Some people assume they have a pet allergy based on their  symptoms, it is important to see your doctor in order to be  certain that you are directing allergy prevention strategies, like  those detailed here, at the correct cause of your symptoms. The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine 2 Veterinary Public Health Program   Department of Veterinary Preventive Medicine   1920 Coffey Road Columbus OH, 43210 vet.osu.edu/vph-mph Myth: My dog’s hair/fur causes my allergy symptoms. Fact: The primary dog allergen is produced in the salivary  glands making saliva the main source. The allergens can  be deposited on the dog’s fur through licking, and once the  fur dries, the particles can flake off and become airborne.  Additionally, there are other minor allergens also shed by  dogs that can trigger allergies. One of the newly discovered  allergens is found in dog urine and is believed to contribute  to an increasing number of allergic reactions to dogs. MYTH: Hypoallergenic dogs produce no allergens so they  do not cause allergies. FACT: All dogs produce allergens. The level of different  types of allergens may vary between individual dogs, but  this is not due to a specific gender, breed, or breed mix.  Some allergic individuals tolerate some dogs better than  others due to variations in amounts and types of allergens  produced. However, in spite of advertising claims and higher  prices, no dogs are truly hypoallergenic. MYTH: The length of my dog’s hair/fur affects the amount  of allergen produced. FACT: The production of dog allergens is not related to  hair type or length.  Even hairless dogs produce allergens.  Some dogs do shed less hair than others and that may  impact how widely allergens are spread in the environment;  however, even that does not guarantee a reduction in  allergen exposure. Regardless of hair characteristics,  allergens are still produced in the dog’s saliva and urine. Dog Specific Controls:  ☐Bathe dogs regularly (ideally at least once a week) to remove  allergens from their fur. For your dog’s health use a shampoo  formulated for dogs; all brands tested perform equally well at  reducing allergens.   ☐Restrict dogs from rooms where reduced exposure is desired  (e.g., bedrooms). Airborne dog allergen levels have been found  to be much higher in rooms where dogs are physically present.  ☐Couches have been shown to harbor a large amount of  allergens, so it is recommended to keep dogs and other pets   off of furniture.  ☐Always wash your hands immediately after handling your pet.   General Household Controls:  ☐Avoid “dry” cleaning (brooms and feather dusters) which can  aerosolize pet allergens. Instead use statically charged cleaning  products (eg swiffer) and/or clean with wet supplies such as  damp cloths and mops which will trap and remove allergens. Reduce your exposure to allergens by following the  allergy prevention tips below. Reducing the amount of allergens in your household can  dramatically reduce symptoms of allergies. Best results in  reducing allergens are found when the recommendations listed  here are applied consistently over time. It may take weeks  before results are noticed. Can medical treatment help? When reducing allergen exposure is not enough, there are  many options for controlling allergies and reducing symptoms  through medical management. Depending on the severity  of signs, over the counter (OTC) medicines may provide  temporary allergy relief for symptoms such as runny/itchy  nose and throat, sneezing and itchy/watery eyes. In all cases  talking with your doctor is highly recommended; as some  people may benefit from prescription medicine, allergy  immunotherapy (allergy shots), or other medical treatments .  Some with severe allergies and asthma may be discouraged  from owning pets; however, most people can effectively  manage their symptoms. What should I do if I cannot keep my dog? If prevention and treatment efforts are not enough and your  allergy symptoms are severe, you may need  to find a new home for your dog. Ask family  and friends about placement options before  contacting your local animal shelter . It is also  important to understand that having an allergy  to one type of animal increases your risk of  allergy to another, but it does not guarantee  it. Many people are allergic to dogs, but not  necessarily allergic to other common pet  species.  ☐When laundering bedding, clothing, and other washable items  (including dog beds) use high temperatures and detergents to  remove more allergens.  ☐Vacuum regularly, at least once a week, with a good vacuum  cleaner that is equipped with a HEPA filter to prevent outflow of  the contents (including pet allergens) that have been swept up.  ☐Allergic individuals should avoid cleaning and vacuuming  themselves, or wear a disposable dust mask (available at the  local pharmacy or hardware store) in order to prevent inhalation  of pet allergens. After cleaning it will take a few hours for  allergens released into the air to settle back onto the surfaces.    ☐In addition to using a HEPA filter in household heating and  cooling systems, the use of an air purifier with a HEPA filter in the  room where pets spend the most of their time will reduce the   concentration of allergens in the air.  ☐When possible, replace carpet with smooth flooring (e.g., wood,  tile, linoleum) as carpets are the primary reservoir of allergens in  the home.
